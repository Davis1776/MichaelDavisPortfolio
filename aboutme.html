				<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
				<p> With a proven history of spearheading innovative programs, I have taken a data analytics 
					and research driven approach to managing projects across the country while leading marketing,
					advocacy, and digital campaigns. Working in over 30 states, I have employed a collaborative
					research-based approach to restructuring and growing powerful organizations while generating
					over $33 million in fundraising.
					<br><br>
					In 2007, I opened my own consulting firm which focused on developing targeted messaging for
					business organizations. I have served as President and CEO of multiple statewide associations, 
					SVP at a national association, and as a Vice President for the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. 
					I have had the opportunity to give hundreds of presentations to CEOs, business leaders, 
					clients, board of directors, media, and other statekholders.
					<br><br>
					While leading a statewide business association in Washington state, I led the developement of a
					statwide data platform that created models of audiences to microtarget persuadable groups by
					collecting over 4,000 data points on nearly seven million individuals. Here is the schemetic
					I designed for this platform:

				<br><br>

				<p> In 2010, I created and led the team that developed a strategic and cutting-edge digital campaign
					which included the first-ever U.S. nationwide buyout of YouTube by a political candidate or
					organization that was described in the media as one of the five “best of the best programs”
					across the country. In 2012, I again created and led a team that was among the first three clients
					in the nation to utilize Twitter's promoted products for the three Presidential debates.

				<h3>Career Transition</h3>
				<p> My strongest passion is in data analysis and using predictive analytics to deliver a
					product or message to a specific audience. I am a well organized, detail oriented individual with
					strong interpersonal and presentation skills that loves to use a data-driven, research-based
					aproach to tell a story from an interesting dataset.
					<br><br>
					I am currently making a career transition and would like to help a company by using my
					enhanced data analytical skills to work closely with internal technical teams and 
					outward facing clients/customers/constituents. I am looking for a role as either a business
					intelligence analyst, data analyst, or technical project director. I believe my previous roles 
					where I served as an executive with several organizations paired with my new data skills will provide
					value to a company by connecting seasoned leadership and soft skills with the technical aspects of 
					data analytics. This is an exciting transitional period and I am looking forward to the	future!
				</p>

				<hr class="divider">
				<h3>Education and Continued Learning</h3>
				<p> I have also owned a successful consulting firm specializing in public opinion research,
					business analytics, demographic analysis, digital marketing, and organizational management while 
					representing Fortune 500 companies,	national and state associations, local government, and media 
					organizations. I believe strongly in	continuing education and completed the Butler University 
					Data Analytics and Visualizaion Executive Education certificate program in May, 2020. 
					This bootcamp covered an extensive curriculum of Python, SQL, Tableau, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
					Machine Learning, Tableau, and Excel.
					<br><br>
					I have continued to enjoy expanding my skills and have recently earned additional certificates from the
					University of California, Davis in Essential Design Principles for Tableau and Fundamentals of
					Visualization with Tableau.
					<br><br>
					In 2018, I earned a Customer Analytics Certificate from The Wharton School of the
					University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I earned the Institute of Organizational Management (IOM) 
					professional designation from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and I received my BA in Political Science 
					with a minor in Economics from Indiana University.
