					<h3>Aims</h3>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">AIM 1: Evaluate existing data from the Indiana
							Property Disclosure datasets</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">AIM 2: Analyze data for weather, home sales, and
							Census data to find correlations within each dataset</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">AIM 3: Design tables and utilize Open Weather Map
							(API), Kaggle (CSV), U.S. Census (API)</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">AIM 4: Utilize Analysis tools such as: Json |
							Python | CSV | pgAdmin 4</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">AIM 5: Provide data on if weather impacts the
							home sales in Indiana</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Impact and Intended Results</h3>
					<p> The Hoosier State enjoys all four seasons of the year. No
						matter what time of year it is, you’ll find something fun to do outdoors
						thanks to our Midwestern location. In recent years, Indiana has been listed as one of the top
						growth states in terms of USA population. Since Indiana experiences all four
						seasons, the question to explore is how weather impacts homesales.
						<br><br>
						Our goal is to provide the impact of home sales in Indiana based on weather
						utilizing the CSV from Kaggle.
						<br><br>
						We will look at dates, temperature changes, conditions, buyer location per county,
						sale prices, population count, household income, and median home value.

					<h3>Average Temperatures</h3>
					<p> As you might guess, January is typically the coldest month and July the hottest.
						Here are average temperatures for each month.

					<h3>Monthly Precipitation</h3>
					<p> While kids do get to enjoy snow days in Indiana, the summer months bring the most
						precipitation. Check out the monthly averages.

					<h3>The Plan</h3>
					<h3>Steps to Extract and Transform data from the U.S. Census</h3>
					<p> The extracted housing related data source was the U.S. Census and was acquired
						using an API. The specific data set selected was from the 2018 American Community
						Survey 5-Year Survey (U.S. Census ACS) and the data points we selected came from the
						following table: U.S. Census Variables
						<br><br>
						The five-year ACS was selected since it has the most complete housing data. From
						the	table containing approximately 20,000 variables, we selected:
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Median Home Value</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Household Income</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Population</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Median Age</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Per Capita Income</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">State</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">County</li>
					</ul>
					The state and county fields were useful in joining the Census table to the other
					tables. Once the data was called utilizing the Census API, then the data was put 
					into a	pandas dataframe.
					<br><br>

					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Transforming the U.S. Census housing related data
						</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Fields were converted to integer using .astype.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The first dataframe, us_census_df, called pulled
							data from all 50 states. We created a second dataframe, IN_census, and verified
							the data contained 92 rows - one for each of Indiana's 92 counties.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The county and state fields were pulled as FIPS
							codes and the "us" dependency, the FIPS codes were converted to state 
							and county	names.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Columns were re-sorted for a more natural looking
							arrangement.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The final dataframe, IN_census_3, was also set to a
							csv file called IN_census_file.csv.</li>

					<h3>Steps to Extract and Transform the Home Price Data:</h3>
					<h3>Extract</h3>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The first step was to read in the original CSV
							file. This data	set came from Kaggle and was s titled: Indiana - Property 
							Sales Disclosure. This file is 2GB.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The file was downloaded directly from the website.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Transform</h3>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">This dataset contains 87 columns, including data
							on the buyer, seller, sales price, lot description, tax information, and sales date.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The following columns were selected:</li>
						<ul>
							<li style="margin-left:3em">Parcel1_Acreage</li>
							<li style="margin-left:3em">PropStreet</li>
							<li style="margin-left:3em">PropCity</li>
							<li style="margin-left:3em">PropState</li>
							<li style="margin-left:3em">PropZip</li>

							<li style="margin-left:3em">Buyer1ZIP</li>
							<li style="margin-left:3em">Conveyance_Date</li>
						</ul>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">A .dropna() was performed on the data to drop
							any rows that contain an NaN.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">There were many inconsistencies in the Property
							City column, including	misspellings and differences in the cases of the letters.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">We obtained weather data for 107 Indiana cities.
							Only data for those cities was included in the final home price dataset. 
							To do this, the city list was copied over from the	weather Jupyter notebook. 
							Then the cities needed to be converted to upper case letters to match up
							with the city entries in the home price dataset. A for loop was setup to
							include only those 107 cities.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Columns were renamed to be more descriptive.
							New column names: - Acreage - Property Street - Property City - Property
							State -	Property Zip - Sale Price - Buyer Street - Buyer City - Buyer State -
							Buyer Zip - Conveyance Date</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">We discovered 1,934 duplicates on home_prices.csv file.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Duplicate data was dropped using: .drop_duplicates().</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Finally, the cleaned file was saved as a csv.

					<h3>Steps to Extract and Transform the Weather Data:</h3>
					<h3> Extract</h3>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Our original plan was to get data for the
							specific location and date of each home sale using an API call from 
							Open Weather Map. Historical data was unavailable without a paid 
							subscription. This was true of many	other weather websites as well.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Weather data was scraped from the following
							website:
							<a
								href="https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/indiana/united-states/3184">U.S.
								Climate Data</a>
						</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">ChromeDriver was used to collect html data
							from the website and BeautifulSoup was used to extract the parts of the 
							data that we needed.
						</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The first piece of information needed was the URL endpoint for 
							each city to obtain weather data from the tables. This was done by scraping the endpoints.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">An empty dataframe titled average_monthly
							was created to hold the	scraped data. A for loop was created to cycle through the URLs and
							the pandas function	.read_html() was used to collect the data from the tables on the
							page. A column was added to include the name of the city. This was done by splitting the URL
							string using the pandas	function .split(“/”), and then indexing the component containing the
							name of the city.</li>

					<h3>Transform</h3>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The columns were transposed and then the
							files merged back together so the averaged weather data became columns.</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">A County column was added so that the
							census data and the weather table were joined. The home price data was 
							joined via the city name.
						</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em">Please note that in this dataframe some
							“NaN” values were intentionally
							left in. Data is present for all cities for the average high and
							low temperatures, but snowfall
							data is only available for 64 of the 107 cities.</li>
